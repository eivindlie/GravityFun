# GravityFun

GravityFun is a tiny program created for fun, and lets you play around with forces of gravity simulated on lots of tiny objects. They all interact with each other, and with the mouse pointer.

[**Witness it in action here!**](https://eivindlie.github.io/GravityFun/index.html)

To switch between attraction and repulsion, click once on the screen. To disable interaction with the mouse, and only let the bodies interact with each other, double click.
